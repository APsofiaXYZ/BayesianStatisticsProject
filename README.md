A model of cell-to-cell interaction for analysis of tumor pathology images

Team members: Diana Isaeva, Alexandra Pershakova, Maria Vittoria Trussoni

Cancer is a complex desease characterized by uncontrolled cells growth. It was shown that cell-cell interactions play a vital role in the progression of cancer. Studies of spatial patterns and interactions among different types of cells provide clinicians with insights into tissue disease progression and can shed light on the underlying biological mechanisms.
Bayesian approach provides solid foundation and variety of computational methods for modeling with prior information about parameters and statistical inference for posterior. Spatial pattern analysis methods are applicable in many other areas and fields where spatial models give answers to the questions of prediction and understanding the structure and mechanisms. 

We aim to study the model for lymphocyte, stromal and tumor cells interaction proposed elsewhere (Li, Q. et al. 2018). We aim to show that model-based image analysis can be a useful technique for medical specialists to make patients prognosis.
